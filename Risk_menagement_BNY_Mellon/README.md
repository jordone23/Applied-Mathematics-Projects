This semester-long project was dedicated to the analysis and modeling of financial risk in the banking sector, using BNY Mellon as a case study. We focused on identifying key types of risk, with particular emphasis on market and currency risk. We conducted a statistical analysis of extreme exchange rate fluctuations (EUR/USD and GBP/USD), applying methods such as Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and quantile estimation to derive risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR). Tools: R (data analysis and modeling), LaTeX/PowerPoint (presentations), teamwork.
